## ðŸš€ Welcome

Welcome to the official **Mako CSS** Framework repository!

## ðŸ’¡ What is Mako CSS?

**Mako CSS** is an open-source utility-class CSS framework designed to be:
- ðŸ’¼ **Clean**: Clear, semantic class names and structure.
- âš¡ **Lightweight**: No JavaScript dependencies, only what you need.
- ðŸŒˆ **Beautiful**: Thoughtfully designed color scales, components, and layouts.
- ðŸ”§ **Customizable**: Easy to adapt and extend.

It borrows inspiration from modern tools like Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Bulmaâ€”then strips it down to just whatâ€™s necessary, with extra polish and personality.

## ðŸŒŠ Why Mako CSS?

We built Mako CSS because we wanted a framework that was:

- **Elegant by default**, without needing to learn 300 utility classes.
- **Simple to pick up** for beginners, yet flexible for pros.
- **Perfect for internal tools, prototypes, or small teams** who need something functional and fast.
