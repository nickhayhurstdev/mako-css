## 🚀 Welcome

Welcome to the official **Mako CSS** Framework repository! Whether you're building dashboards, UIs, landing pages, or internal tools, Mako gives you the essential building blocks with a polished modern look—and none of the overhead.

## 💡 What is Mako CSS?

**Mako CSS** is an open-source utility-class CSS framework designed to be:
- 💼 **Clean**: Clear, semantic class names and structure.
- ⚡ **Lightweight**: No JavaScript dependencies, only what you need.
- 🌈 **Beautiful**: Thoughtfully designed color scales, components, and layouts.
- 🔧 **Customizable**: Easy to adapt and extend.

It borrows inspiration from modern tools like Bootstrap, Tailwind, and Bulma—then strips it down to just what’s necessary, with extra polish and personality.

## 🌊 Why Mako CSS?

We built Mako CSS because we wanted a framework that was:

- **Elegant by default**, without needing to learn 300 utility classes.
- **Simple to pick up** for beginners, yet flexible for pros.
- **Perfect for internal tools, prototypes, or small teams** who need something functional and fast.
- **Framework-agnostic**, plug-and-play with any frontend setup (Vanilla JS, Vue, Laravel, React, etc.)

## 🧑‍💻 Who made Mako CSS?

Mako CSS is built and maintained by [Nick Hayhurst](https://github.com/nhayhurst), a passionate software engineer from the UK 🇬🇧. With years of experience working across systems, UIs, and tooling, Nick brings developer-first thinking to every line of code in the framework.
